# Solar-Radiation-Analysis
Predicting the trend of solar energy radiation using various ML algorithms

Introduction <br>
Today, Solar Energy being a source of renewable energy is very important for human kind. Most of the nations are trying to increase their solar energy production. We can
increase this energy production if we can observe the solar radiation pattern in an area of solar power plant.<br>

Dataset <br>
 SolarPrediction.csv dataset <br>
 This dataset contains various columns such as Radiation,Wind Speed, Date, Humidity etc.<br>
 It comprises of records from the year 2016-2017 <br>
 It has 32,686 instances <br>

Data Modelling <br>
1. Pre- Processing – <br>
  a. Data Cleaning <br>
  b. Data Transformation <br>
  c. Feature and correlation analysis <br>
  
2. Apply ML Algorithms – <br>
  a. Linear Regression<br>
  b. Random Forest Regression<br>
  c. SVR<br>
  d. Decision Tree Regression<br>
  e. Adaboost Regression<br>
  
3. Visualizations – <br>
  a. Distribution and trends of the features against the target variable(Radiation) <br>
  b. Actual vs Predicted values for the regressors<br>
  c. Month-wise metric variation <br>
  
Conclusion<br> 
After applying various regression algorithms, we can calculate various comparison factors such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2 scores. After analysing the
final results, Random Forest Regressor works best for the dataset.<br>
